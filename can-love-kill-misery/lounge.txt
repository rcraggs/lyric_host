Can a love song tell you what you need to know? I don't think so
I'm not sure they're even worth my time.
It seems so long ago "the end of June" how did I ever finish that tune?
I don't really know, and even when I was not in love,
this fool would try and fail and say "I'd love to"

So if I ever start to write again, please stop me. 
It doesn't mean there's nothing I could say
It's just I could have built a tower for you in the time it's taken me to write this
It never used to be so, perhaps it means I am not in love, 
but hey, if that's the case I'd say "I've love to"

My heart is racing and my pulse is gathering speed
as I lie here beside you, it's almost just as if I'm
dying, and my pulse won't stop gathering speed
I try to speak but I don't want to. 

So, here's to you. Nothing you've not head before but this time it's a tune.
This is how I feel, I've committed it to record as a small opus in G

Don't go looking for reasons, there are no reasons
Just try to look reasonably pleased

Some people simply do not pick good notes, maybe I don't
I swear I used to not so long ago
You wake up wearing my pyjamas, graffiti d'italiana 
I still need you close, even when I wan not in love
but I will cry and shake and say "I'd love to"

Break your little hear, and graft it onto mine
Don't ask me how I am, I'm fine, suffice to say
So did this tell you all you needed to know?
... didn't think so.
