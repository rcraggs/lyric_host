I wish I could be, king for a day
Suddenly everyone cares what you say.
You ask me and I say I'm fine, in truth I haven't been fine your years

If I could be, king for a day
Everything's broken and someone must pay

Do you think you'll find what you're looking for
Just maybe I'm what you're looking for 
I am out there somewhere, are you other there?

I dreamt I was stupid and free of contempt 
The most beautiful thing I may ever have dreamt
You yell and I sigh "I'm coming" 
but I don't know where you're yelling from

What chance I'll find what I'm looking for, When I'm not sure if I'm looking?
Are you out there somewhere, I am out there.

Put on your coat we're throwing out the litter
Times on our side for a change
And if I didn't know any better
I would say I was due a little luck, things could be a little better
[but they're always the same - in the original lyrics but no subsequent recordings]

If I could be king for day, I'd procrastinate, abdicate and fade away
You ask me and I way I'm fine, I'm surprised that I even answered

Do you think I'll ever find what you're looking for 
when I'm pretty sure you left me to follow your dreams?
I am out there somewhere, are you out there?
