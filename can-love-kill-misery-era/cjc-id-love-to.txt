Cath, here's to you. Nothing you have heard before
but this time put to music

In case you don't know how I feel, I've committed it to record as a small opus in G

I cannot give you reasons, there are no reasons, 
Just hope you're reasonably pleased

When I sleep it's just not the same
so I'd travel half way 'round the world to kiss you wide awake

You might think that sounds insane
But if I looked as good as you I'd sure you'd do the same.

Though I've no love of sickness I'd gladly catch a cold from you
In fact I'd love to
Whatever it is you want, I'd love to
You'd barely have to ask
But if I break your little heart, I'd happily give you mind
No need to ask me cause I'm doing fine, since you're alive
