I'm going to spend the next 4 hours
Sat at the end of your bed
I'm going to tell you everything I've ever done and all the things I've ever said

I shall spare no details, and I shan't spare you innocence or my modesty
I challenge you to sleep through this

Every scream you hear will be exactly as it was
Every glow you feel will symbolise the pain and how it was back them
This will be the worst night of your life
You'll age 23 years but in the morning we can sleep together at peace again

You and I at peace again
I challenge you to sleep through this but I urge you to listen
You give me a chance to explain then you and I can sleep all day
Rest in love and at peace again
