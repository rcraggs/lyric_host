I'm your host, the agent with the secret smile
And if you know then I'll have to go for a little while.

I'm so cold, I always fold, when the takes are high
And I've got pills in the sole of my soul my wings tips suicide. 

Yeah yeah yeah listen to the telephone
Yeah yeah yeah wonder in and out of your home
when you're not at home I tamper with your radio

I can show you anything you need to know
you can search for me high and low
I'm afraid that I've gotta go

To society high
