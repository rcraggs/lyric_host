I've got leaves cluttering my lullaby
Cutting my fingers right down to the bone

On the breeze blowing my tears away making my skin song get stuck in my thoughts
Wind, just like customs of some other land nature and colour we don't understand

Leaves covering everything, turn the summer from bright into dark
Trees standing like monoliths, lovers initials still carved in the bark
