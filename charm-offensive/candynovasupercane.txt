I'd love to blow myself a kiss and wave goodbye to all of this
cause as the street cracks under me I cry for the last time
as dreams and doubt of superstition suddenly come into fruition
we stare towards the looming end and hope that you'll forgive me friend

For all the days I stayed at home for fear of being cast alone
the sound of my own empty voice has left me with no other choice
to rise above the people who will never ever learn

The hopes we have are nothing more than one big daunting open door
while they sit back and hate the ride I think it's time to step inside
cause as we watch our bridges burn we know there's still so much to learn
please find it in your heart of hearts to realise why I fall apart
it's nothing that you might have said it's just a problem with my head
and God knows there's enough of them and that's why I must leave you friend

and through these lilting lullabies I never really said goodbye 
for all the things I meant to say candynovasupercane

The pavements mean so much to me I'd like to sit and watch them bleed
we've wallowed so much in this blood these children of a lesser good
don't know there's a better world than drunken men and ugly girls
and suffocate in this decay while we all rise to start again

So everybody dream aloud it's all we have, except for sound
of supertentious ego shite that comes to haunt me every night
when I want nothing more than sleep when I can pretend that I'm not me, 
but superstars that never fall. (perhaps it is me, after all)
to all of you who through all weather somehow kept me help together 
to all of you and my Elaine, CNSC
