I'd like to lock you in a box inside a room and
dance around the town and then pretend that I am human
then I'd fly to Vegas and then terrorise the dancers
ask a stupid questions and then tell them all the answers
Scatter all your dreams and then put 'em in a corner
roll up to a funeral and laugh at all the mourners
drink a drink called poison to elixiate my laughter
Live a life of sin happily ever ever after

I told a joke about a bloke inside a car crash
nobody laughed and now I'm waiting for the backlash
I cannot leave now cause my foot is stuck in the door
I like it here and I'll stay for ever ever ever ever more

Drunk drive, live a lie, heavy metal samurai 
Psycho silent child

What about it?
What about it?
