Open up my wound, see how maggots seem to think I'm good enough for food. Unlike you
Smelling like a whore, you don't have to bite to see I'm rotten to the core, like you

Take it like a man, or take it like the boy I am
Fake it over and over
Fallen to the floor, find my pride and rape it til I cannot take no more of you

Greed defines the words
Try real hard to disregard everything you heard from me
weeping like a child, crying for the nights and all the Gods we left behind

And my machines will swoop at you, in mourning

Chipping at my bones, throw me in the petri-dish
set my thousand clones on me
Velvet through and through, hard then the hardest rock that someone every threw at you
pretty though we are, I am much too distant to admire from afar so far
