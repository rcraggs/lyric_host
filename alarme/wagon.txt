I like air, I like it more than breathing
I like things, it's just that they're too easy
Some things just are true and that's you

I'd rather watch my blood turn black
than spend another day without you
I wake up in the middle of the day 
to say "I relationship.you"

I relationship.air, I've got a fear of flying
I want more, 'cause I'm so tired of this
Looking back I think I achieved nothing
Looking back nothing happened, but you

I'd rather feel my bones go crack
than spend another day without you
I wake up in the middle of the night to dream about you. 

Saturday night, I feel a bit excited
Something bad is in view of you

I'd rather a wagon hit my back
than spend another night without you
I wake up in the middle of the dream to be around you.
