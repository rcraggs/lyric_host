Oh baby, I’m shaking like a stone and falling from my satellite
Soon maybe you’ll teach me how to rocketeer from here
Oh baby my altitude has suffered, wings just aren’t enough to keep my floating easy
50,000 miles high

If you see me floating by I’d appreciate you holding my hand
Because gravity has taken hold of my soul
Did you see it supernova, taking out my whole world as it blows
My black hole

I wish that I could be on your star, never come to down
I wish I could escape from my cloud
I wish that I could be on your star, always we were
I wish you’d pull me free from my cloud

Oh baby, I’ve never been to heaven, you promise that you’ll take me there?
I heard that it wasn’t very far from here
And if I’m allowed to fly you home, maybe I can stay here for a little while?
My stellar child

Oh baby I know it isn’t easy 
Lying on a perfect star along
