Run away from home, fight against the pull
everyone here is dumb and beautiful
From my people's arms you'll find sentiments and charms bountiful.

Feel the salty air brush against your skin, 
cast off your robes and neither sink nor swim saying I have heard 
that son you're not a bird. Don't try flying

Sent into this restless world, I'm a quiet reverb
Out into the solid earth, I'm a quiet reverb

People all around me say that it's too late to grow. 
I don't know better so I guess that so 
Tell me something new and I'll take it to be true every time

Head up in the clouds feet down on the floor. 
Not really sure what I've been living for 
Gentle arms to guide in somewhere safe to hide.
