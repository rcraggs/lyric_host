I love to feel you hand on my sore and blemished skin
It means I'm touching you
I love you see your lips arching as they search for mine. It means you're smiling too

You know I'll never ?? you, you know I'll never leave
I hope you feel the same you know

I love to feel your hair as it cascades on my face
It means you're over me
And I hope you think the name when I do those lover things
It means that you're in love

You put my brain into overdrive
I'm fairly in love and I'm barely alive
The public gets what the public wants
Well it can't have me
You put my brain into such high gears
My heart cannot break and my legs cannot steer
and could you please just tell the world I'm not coming home again?

I try to read you and each time I gaze into your eyes
it's not too hard to do
and if you can't decide what is my ?? and empty mind
I'm thinking about you.
