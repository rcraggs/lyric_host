God is dead. Roll out the new lords
I'll take them all on, right here, right now 
Becky she called out, "burn down the night sky
Shine on your people". "fuck em all" I say.

Now that she's blown me and left me to die
Piss on my grey sky

Here with you, blinded by lens flare
I smile like I still care, maybe I do
and as the static it bonds us like glue
There's someone else who'll die for you

And I will try real hard to be here for you
whether or not you want me to
And all I have I'll gladly give to you
All of the rumours are true

The king is dead, bring me the queen's heart.
I'll tear you all apart, right here right now
Somebody stop me, I can't help myself
before I turn into somebody (else)

[Chorus]

Curse this great mind, sometimes I'd rather not be alive

Here with you, blinded by lens flare
staggering nowhere, following you
Sometimes I'm staggered by what I can't do
Maybe

[Chorus]
