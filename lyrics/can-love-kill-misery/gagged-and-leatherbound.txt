Write down, all the things you dare not say out loud.
Yell them out. Feel how good confessions sound
When you told me, all the things you wrote
It sounded better than I ever could have hoped.
So now it's my turn. Quote, unquote.

Calm down, it's not a coffin just a box I painted brown
Gagged and Leather-bound, the poetry I camouflaged on muddy ground.
Empty pages, often say much more, than the bookfuls of dark verse I'd wrote before
I'd rather bleeding fingers than aching jaw

I'm not leaving, I'm already gone, 
Coasting alone along my slow but definite departure
You cannot describe how you feel with a pen
My voice is intact, but I don't want to sing my life again

Maybe we should give up art in favour of TV
Sit naive absorbing nearly everything I see
But I despise someone telling me to cry
so I decline and smile

I can't find a channel, that tells me how I feel
So I start redrawing scenes from memory
That I have never seen, describe them to me
