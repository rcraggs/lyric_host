The kind of low that I can't feel anymore
battered my shyness into submission, so now you can ask me directly

I've taken up residency right outside your door
In all likelihood you'll think that's funny, the joke is you now have to let me

In your home, and thrust your true love deep into my soul	
No doubt about it, I'd rather bleed from your veins than my own
Love by intimidation, there's no need to be scared, 
as I'm lying uninvited on your bed

I'll pepper you with jokes 'til I hit your funny bone
A tragic comedy carpet bombing
Don't stop me even if you've heard this


A thousand times this time it may contain a punchline, 
Or a weakly concealed smile

Your eyes penetrates the atmosphere, a starts reminding me of la la la la la Love
A thin voice appears, "I will take you out of here and go to some place we're alone"

Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria  
Gloria oh, tonight I feel terrible. Curling up as a 6-foot fetus
Gloria oh, inside I feel terrible. And I rarely feel much better than this

Take me home, take my shell and fill it with your soul
and I'll never ask you why

Your eyes penetrates the atmosphere, a voice reminding me of la la la la la love
A thin voice appears, says "I will take you out of here and go"
My childish fears soar into the stratosphere, descends to shower you with la la la la la love
Green light appears, says "I will take you out of here and go to some place we're alone"
