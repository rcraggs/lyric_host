I lost a fight with a girlfriend in '93 I've got the scars to prove it
She gave me knocks an bruises and a Commodore 16. I don't know how to use it

But the advice, she gave me, was unlike, a lady. My head's stopped spinning round

I gave my life to the army for green velveteen. I've got the haircut to prove it.
I tried to fight for my country. I was too drunk to see. They all said "who're you foolin'"

The demise of the 80s was blamed on a lady who'd sell her soul for a pound

So as the rain keeps coming down, and the smart boys go to ground
and as my friends all leaving town. I'm just a loose end hanging round. 

I found a girl in the gutter on a dimly lit street but she fell in love immediately 
She had degrees in science and awards for bravery
she looked at my like vermin

Then I looked at her one way and ran in the other. I'd gone before she noticed.
