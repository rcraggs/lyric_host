More rain than you've ever seen, filling up the rivers and streams
trying to burst their banks on me
More stars than you knew were there, glitter out their solar glare
though it hurts your eyes to stare

More jolts than the earth can take, manifest in a rattle and shake
I can feel the fabric breaking
More clouds than the sky can hold, disappear as the scene unfolds, 
Should've known, I'd seen it coming.

You've gotta get out, there's a parasite on the way
Tastes like kissing ginger and it's coming in from outer-space
If you wanna get out, there's a satellite on the way
Stay with me on this world and there'll be another Saturday

Last night when I closed my eyes, I could feel the deathly silence
being broken by a distant rumble
Black scars on the planet's face ??? the end of the human race
We're safe inside the bunker

Out the water comes a girl, laced on carbon, bathed in wonder
Told me of another world where they care for one another
She turned around and walked away said to follow didn't bother
But there's a better life on the way. I blame myself for the [lyrics ends here]
