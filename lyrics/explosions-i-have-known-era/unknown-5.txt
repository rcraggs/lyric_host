Bored of it all, Bored of it all, Bored of it all, now
Tired of trying, bored of failing, sick of dropping out.

So I'm going to breath until I fall on my knees
I'm going to say "goodbye"

Mother tell me, why'd you worry? I will be alright.
I'm a rock and you have shown me, how to find the light

And oh my god, we don't deserve to be here at all
