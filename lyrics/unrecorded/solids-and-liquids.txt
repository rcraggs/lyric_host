I know one day that I'm gonna die and when I do I don't want to know everything everyybody's every known about anything (ever)

I've a phobia of sleeping alone, with nobody to tell me that it's alright to be a bit frightened so turn on the light.

Yeah! electrify my chair, it's not as if I value my hair

I phone you up to ask if I'm fine. You pause a while and tell me I'm alright if a little bit tired. 

Yeah! sleeping in my underwear
