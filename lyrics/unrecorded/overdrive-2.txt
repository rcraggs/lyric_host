You put my brain into overdrive, I'm fairly in love, and I'm fairly alive.
If society gets what society needs, it can't have me
Put my head into such high gears. I heart gonna break in my legs cannot stay. Could you please just tell the world. I'm not coming home again.

Turn my life all upside down into a story
Makes more sense if it's told in a rhyme
Demons start to turn my silver heart all tarnished. 
Hear it racing 1000 bpm.

Had enough of this to last me years

Becky had a little lamb his face was white as snow
And everything she does he's sure to blow

Thrust your hands into my tar pit, pulled out a plum
Lick it clean of silvery, green, saliva, darkening goo
Schoolgirl charm you never really learnt your lesson
Sit right down, I'll teach you something new
