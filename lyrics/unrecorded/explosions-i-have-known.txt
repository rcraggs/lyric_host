Ooh babe, I know you know my name I feel your pain by looking.

Oh, now I kicked you when you're down.
My head is bowed, so if you're walking out, 
just do while true, but I will lose everything with you 
do while true

Ooh girl, you're more than just my world 
your my future now and past you're everything I have 
you could split my world into you're all I ever need but if you're going to leave just do while true

If you're gonna leave shoot me now to make it easy 
and if you wanna go I'd rather not know until tomorrow 
things I have blown up explosions that I have known 
I've offered you everything now you gonna just take it away 

and if you wonder if I love you just do
