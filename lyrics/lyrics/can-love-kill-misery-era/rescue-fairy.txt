The dry ice settles and the overture begins to play
The overture is not afraid, it's been here before

The lines stick in my throat like something I'm ashamed to say
The cracks appearing in my face are much more than they paid for

There'll be no second time, I'm never stepping out again
The stage is meant for better men with bigger hair and straighter teeth
and browner tans, when suddenly

A green light penetrates the atmosphere a voice reminding me of 
la la la la la love
A thin voice appears says 'I will take you out of here'
