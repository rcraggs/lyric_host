Two years on and four years older, 
My conscience is a parrot that sits on my shoulder, 
begging me not to be so stupid again 
'cause he remembers disassemblence for the first time we met. 
Oh yes or no

Two years on and non the wiser 
I'm flicking through these pages it's a gentle reminder
of the hundred also melodies I wrote in your name 
It's shameful and it's painful and it's happening again. 
Oh lord oh no.

The toss of a coin declares you love me.
Best 2 out of three you love me not
The roll of a die, well, it lies 
and I'm sick of being lied to by inanimate objects

I still live for the memory of walking you home 
But for Christ's sake Richard, that was almost 3 years ago earlier
Alea iacta ce n'est pas

Sure we can be just good friends if I can kiss you
Spend all my time with you and sleep in your bed
So let us retire to my room, I promise not to say "I love you"
Despite the fact I do
