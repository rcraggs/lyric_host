Pick me up, throw me down
turn around, I'm on longer there
I'm outta here and please try not to follow

Piss me off, call me names, 
so what? I no longer care
You can break my bones but that's my final offer

This is my last sad song so please remember it well
A final verse, a chorus and a coda

Don't ask me about Miss Gray, I lost her a long time ago
And heaven knows I miss her now I'm older
I loved her far too long, I'll cry for one final time
Well, maybe twice, but that's my final offer

I spent too long inside

So tell me, why I try. Why, then, do I bother?
Not a soul out there listens or cares.
I'll even hang myself, but that's my final offer
not a dry eye in the house this year

Just label me insane, that's fine. I play the role well
Oh, what the hell, I'll even wear the jacket.
And may one day soon, I can say I am not in love. 
But maybe not, It's something of a habit

Can you, guess who this time?


So tell me, why I try. Why, then, do I bother?
Not a soul out there listens or cares.
I'll even hang myself, but that's my final offer
not a dry eye in the house this year
performers or anyone
I don't know, no no no no no no no.
