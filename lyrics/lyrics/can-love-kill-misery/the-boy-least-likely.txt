Traveling lightly, fumbling blindly 
The boy least likely to know
If I find out it'll frighten me, 
so probably best that I don't.
But if you don't show me or talk me through slowly
how do you expect me to follow?

Please look at me that way.
With shuffling shoes and a shortening fuse
but that's how I'm going to stay

Tonight's excuse is the rain
There's my bedroom light so it's Friday night, 
inside again for a change.

When castacodabreaka failed to make us into millionaires
There's a million different things which I'd let myself become unaware

Life's not multiple changes to fail. It's a bell-shaped curve
and it's all I deserve to spend the rest of my life in the tails


I preport to be awfully clever
It's necessarily so, as I've decided to go
and leave the planet earth altogether

But the path to inner peace will never lead me to temptation, I doubt
I'm tempted just to find my own way there rather than go without

Help me to enumerate the possibilities of fate
one rainy Sunday afternoon
Prosperity and happiness, I don't think so
All I ever dream of is headroom.

Returning to the point in hand. 
What else could I be but my own worst enemy 
it's difficult to understand
When writing morbid melody developed me a cynical view
I huffed and puffed and blew it big time
beating myself up black and blue
