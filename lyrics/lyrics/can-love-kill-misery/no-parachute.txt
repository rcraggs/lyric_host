I stayed around to admire your reflection
I did not intend to draw your attention
My truths removed the smile you were wearing
I hope you don't mind if I continue staring

I feel you with me as I'm falling down again
But if you aren't going to be my parachute
You don't wanna be the one to break my fall

You helped me believe that I deserved so much more
So I left the plane and pulled the ripcord
As the ground speeds towards me, I reassess my value
It's all your fault, I thought it only fair if I tell you

Now I'm trying to love myself, I'm not nearly quite so dull
It used to be 'not single' and it's no longer enough
I need your help again to pick my pieces up, 
You saved me and I'm grateful, but it's simply not enough

Come round take a look. 
There's a boy right here that wants to be in love
Please help, left to my own devices, 
I'm picking up new vices daily
