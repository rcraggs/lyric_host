If I find a pot of gold would it make you happy?
and if I ran away from home would you lock the door behind me?
There's a light on in my window but it doesn't mean I'm staying home tonight

If I'd lost my job and wife would you dare to tell me?
'Cause the messenger gets shot like all the rest
There's a message in my wallet, it says "Catherine, take care" yeah.

All I want is to be happy, all I want is to get by. 
And I can't get either right.
All I want's for you to love me. All you gotta do is try
But you can't get either right.

If I die right now, I'll be in hell for breakfast
If I go tonight do you think anyone will notice?
I've got some loose ends to tie up, of that I'm well aware.

Don't go there, I didn't go there. After the lord mayor's show
I didn't need to, I didn't know where
I didn't feel right, it doesn't smell right, I would have done any other night.
Why did I go there, I didn't know yeah.
