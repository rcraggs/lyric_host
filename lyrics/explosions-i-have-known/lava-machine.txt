There's a first time for everything there is a pain in my heart uh-ho
But if you don't wanna feed it then you don't want to know 

Well I ain't got an attitude and I don't think I could be rough 
You say that I am beautiful I guess it's not enough 

Well I've never seen a girl so cool and I'm desperate and it shows in my eyes 
so I'll cry and I'll cry just to show that I'm hurting inside 

It's over, don't you care how I feel? The girl with the lava machine 
And I don't care if I'm making a scene. The girl with the lava machine 
And I'll try be alright if it makes you feel better but I'll never forget her 
It's over, don't you know this means? The girl in the lava machine 

There is a light in my abdomen I don't think you'll ever go out I may soon be cinders so I wouldn't turn around 

And I never known that this could happen. 
You could hurt someone and say that you care 
I'm a wreck in a mess will pretend it never happened when we meet next year.

You were young, I was vulnerable
But it doesn't make it any more right. 
I can't face the daylight and I can't sleep at night 
And it's hard not to seem so angry when I think about the things that you said 
My life is escaping through the hole that you put in my head.

I'm catching a genius and you do performing arts. 
I may act superior. 
You're still broke my heart and I don't think I'll ever recover and I won't ever be the same. 
I'll nod at your offer but I'll never visit your house again
