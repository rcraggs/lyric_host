She's got a not reason to wake up today 
because she's frightened what the papers will say 
she spent £100,000 on champagne. 
She can't remember if she bothered to pay

She reads the sides of a cereal box. 
She seem so tired and she looks like she's lost. 
She can't remember how much yesterday cost. 
She calls my number, just to see where I was.

She cannot help it if she looks 17, 
She's got lipstick marks all over her teeth. 
She's learnt not to believe the things that you read 
So much so much that you wouldn't believe

Oh, she's falling down falling down x2
I get so frightened when I see her coming up to me

[Lyrics that were not on the recording:
   No way I'll ever believe, I can't believe she's fallen for me]

She shouts obscenities at kids in the street. 
She causes accidents whenever she's here
You have to touch it to make sure that she's real. 
She sometimes calls me just to see how she feels. 

She wears a ribbon in her auburny hair
She'll make you happy with things that she wears, 
She's got a funny way of showing she cares 
Snd she'll kick you just to make you aware.
