Oh the pain, it hit me like a rock in the face

I need to catch a shuttle, it's departing soon
Have to join a battle, us against the moon
Not sure if I'll ever return, or even if I want to 

I've left a lot of memories, gained in little time.
Can't decide if I'm upset to leave it all behind
There were times I wondered about, a girl who blew my mind
I forgot her voice and her taste, but still remember her name
It's Elaine

Now I don my helmet, as I pull the pin
Used to know my way around so well, now I'm lost as sin
If you feel like getting in touch I'll be orbitting
Write a message in smoke across the sky
spelling out your name. 
It's Elaine

I can see you all, french kisses for the masses
and I lost my head this time
Now I believe in heartache at first sight
