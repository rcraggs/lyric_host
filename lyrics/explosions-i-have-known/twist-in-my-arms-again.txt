By the way I'm not happy, 
you can tell by the way you're no longer with me
To kiss me and tell me I'm beautiful
It's not that I'm angry, It's just there's a feeling inside and it hurts me
It feels like I'm rotting away

I believe that I'm dying, so I'll hide in a corner where no-one can find me
To try to make me see sense
'Cause there's no sense in breathing, I'm destined to die here along so just leave me
Believe me I'm not going to change

I'll sit in the rain in a path of a train, 'til I twist in your arms again
Summer's never gonna change a thing my dear, so I'll twist in your arms again

Would you write dear and tell me, is there a chance that you might come and save me?
Please baby
I'm a shell of what I used to be, which is merely a boy that children find scary 
And messed up inside

I'll sit in the rain in a path of a train, and I twist in your arms again
Summer's I'm gonna change a thing my dear, I'll twist in your arms again
I'll break down your arms with my intelligent charms, 'til I twist in your arms again
