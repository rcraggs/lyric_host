Wake up every morning and wonder where you go
It's so hard to find your tracks I wish that it would snow
Oh to be your everything, I'll teach you all I know.

Every time that I wake up get lost inside my head
Try to think what day it is and think of you instead
Everything you said to me I take it all as read
Oh my throbbing head

You do so much to torture me I'm sure it isn't right
Teach me how to make you smile and how to sleep at night
Thank you girl for messing up the best days of my life.
