Is it getting cold? You need a bomb to make me go out.
Just look at all the rain clouds

And is it getting so you need to worry if I'm going to be about?
I may just get lost in town

I'm brilliant to a degree, but I'm not worth anybody's money
Falling down.

You're the antidote to all the junk that's keeping me down
You're the sun to all my rain clouds
And if you wanna be, you'll be the queen who's paining my town
all the colours of a sun shower

February's so cold, but I don't notice anything except my girl
You rock my world
You rock my world, around
You rock my world, around

If I'm getting old I need to find the world in my realm
The one with all her walls down
So I'm lying here with all the tides, the rocks and the sand
With nothing but a fake sun-tan

Let you know the reasons why I cannot hold this thing inside, oh girl
You rock my world ...

Brilliant to a degree, but I'm not worth anybody's money
Nothing but a girl
You rock my world ...
