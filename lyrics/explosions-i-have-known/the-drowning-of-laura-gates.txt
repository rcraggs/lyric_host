Sits by her window watching waves attack the shore
Coming from afar corroding her home
Watches the barricades she build come tumbling down
They don't stop the waves reclaiming ground

Someday there'll be a parade, for the drowning of Laura Gates

They tried to stop you as you ran along the beach 
The sea was calm but the tide was in
Your eyes were crying as you sank just out of reach
"Coming into my arm" you said to me.

Someday your body will return to the grave of Laura Gates, and say

Come into my arms and drown, drown, drown x 2
Come into the sea, I will rescue you, there's so much to do
Come into my arms and drown, drown, drown

They built a statue where you used to sit and cry
I like to go there sometimes
If they just listened to the words you used to sigh
Maybe you still... maybe you'd try
I know it's dangerous to think about yesterday, and say
