I'll decide if I'm good looking
Beauty spots are something for nothing
Have my doubts, you only notice when the lights go on 

Sun is out and kids are playing, out the back the grass is praying
waiting for the door to open to be rolled upon

And I wanna feel like I'm in movies
and I wanna be somewhere no TV
and I wanna know who seems to think life's getting hard
Summer in my back yard

Dry your eyes and tie your hair back
Drink you wine before it goes flat
Friday night night can wait til later when the sun goes down

Are you down the road I know the way
Do you mind if we all come and play?
Living while the sun shines making hey. Hey hey.
