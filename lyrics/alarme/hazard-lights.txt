I’m not scared, well just a little bit
I’m so sussed, handle anything
Don’t be fooled, I’m no better than anyone else
Left by the girl you love

Hope you’re fine, I’m quite worried that 
You’re not coping and I’m very much 
On you mind, and you’re feeling it
Deep inside, trust you baby but

[Chorus]
Now you're gone, all my hazard lights turn on 
burning bright ‘cause I'm not strong 
makes me feel there's something wrong, well just a little bit 
on my own intravenous telephone 
don't shoot till you see the white of her lies

Count to the, breath more deeply and start again
This time feeling much less than well
Don’t start healing ‘til you see her eyes
While not dreaming, but

[Chorus] x 2 (on final chorus ‘feel the bite of her lies’)
