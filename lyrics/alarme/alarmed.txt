I’m no sinner, ‘cause my better half if almost half a world away
And I’m frightened she will hear every word I say
I’m a liar because I always tend to say that I’m ok, 
When I’m really not that great

I’m a loser ‘cause I choose a way of life that isn’t right for me
There’s a million different reasons for my apathy
But none that should alarm you, 
‘Cause you’re with me

[Chorus]
I’m alarmed, ‘cause you never know who’s in your house
I’m alarmed, I just might turn you inside out
I’m alarmed, and I’m going off when you’re around

Panic station trans-oblivion the phone’s great ringing shout
I’m a loner I can’t talk to you, you just might find me out
I’m a singler la la la
I’m a voice la la la la
I’m stressed, I’m calm, I’m alarmed

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I’m a singer la la la
I’m a voice la la la la la la la la 
And I’m alarmed
