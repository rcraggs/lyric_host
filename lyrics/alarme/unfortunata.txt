By rights I should be crying all the way to my grave
I'm pretty vocal in the way in which I'm feeling ok
I didn't think that it would happen, but it's happened
I always thought that it would matter, and it matters
To you.


By rights I should be staring daggers at your head
but I'm tired looking forward to an empty bed
I didn't think I'd be vicious but I'm placid
It doesn't mean to say that it doesn't matter
It does, just not that much.

[Chorus]
I like it, it's unfortunata
I liked you but it doesn't matter
To tell the truth I always knew that this was coming any day
There's so much I'd rather to and it's so hard to talk to you
There's nothing more to say
It's nice in an unfortunate way

To be honest I just think I've grown tired of love
I'm only 12 but I think I've already had enough 
you've just got to accept that these things happen
and hope that your life isn't forming a pattern

[Chorus]

By rights I should be curled up on the bedroom floor
Throwing things at anyone who tries to come through the door
I didn't think that it would happen, but it's happened
I always thought that it mattered, and it matters
To you, and me too.

[Chorus]
