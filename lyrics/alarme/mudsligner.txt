I was in your head, you were in my eyes
Something that you said, shivering up my spine
Sometimes you just have to lose control of it all
Not when I'm alone

Turning very sour, crumble in my skin
Dying on the outside, slowly working in
Some day maybe soon you will know you were close to losing it all

Hold on, things can only get worse
I am mortor I am stone
You will crumble like dirt
I am tender I am hard
and I never promised you
we would never fall apart

Everything I have, coming to an end
Life goes on around me right there and then
and if I can't admit you're all I need
Is it too much to ask you to sit and watch me bleed?

I am tender I am hard
and I never promised you
we would never fall apart, because I do
