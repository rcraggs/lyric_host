Believe your eyes, it’s over and our time is nearly up
The earth shakes as the mantle effervesces through the crust
The end is neigh, the sands of time have clearly had enough
Yet something makes the earth spins round even though noone’s in love

Humankind collecting all the favours it is owed
‘Cause rumour has it, you can take it with you when you go
But if you leave it behind, someone can buy your soul
And sell it to your demons, ‘cause noone’s in control

Out time is up but we still don’t know what it all is for
The meek will inherit the earth, but that’s not us anymore
