Life at a difficult age, too young for getting engaged, and too old to cry for the way that relationship.makes you feel
Life at a difficult speed, too fast to stay on my feet and too slow to fashion my own kind of social disease
Already on my knees, somebody:
 save me, save me, save me

Abuse yourself, use your own pride, two reasons for staying inside
I’ve read all the verses I wrote, so I’ll write some more
Better than being yourself is being the person in front
Stand on the shoulders of giants and take a running jump
Already running to hide, somebody:
Catch me, stop me, slap

Maybe I’m so hard to be about
Or just maybe I’m over and out
Hiding among shadows of a doubt
Tell me baby am I over and out?

Hiding among shadows of a doubt
Tell me baby am I over and out?
Maybe I’m just hard to be about
And just maybe I am over and out
