I'm God's own child, turned good, although I wasn't really that bad 
If you consider what I had, I made the most of it.
I'm never satisfied, I'm never choosing life 
Call me 1 million different names. I'm all of them at once

Get off your arse and sing if there's something to sing about.
I am success incarnate too late to be original. 
But you must all admit 
I'm brilliant
