Throw your body in and make it hot my dear
Throw your arms round me and make me burn
Please ignore these vultures they just circle me
A custom that we've kept for all these years
Yet they fly so low when you're around

Throw me off this world I'm sure you'll catch me dear
Stand beneath me as I start to fall
I am but a fool but you are fooled by me
A genius with beauty? Yes, that's all
Just shut your eyes and open your legs wide, 

I'll go back down
I've not had enough not ever
I relationship.that sounds, oh I do you know
I go back down, I've not had enough not ever
I'll swim and drown, oh until you blow

Come into my arms, I'll come into you mouth
Shine just like the very star you are
Show me sights I'll dip the lights and drip for you
Suddenly the world seems very far
Talk to me I will not answer

[Chorus]

Once you're back on top of things, I'm sure that you will fit me in
Generous unto a fault am I
