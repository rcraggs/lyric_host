Butterlips spreads her legs and starts again
I do, I do not know
Why she don't spread her wings and fly away
She sure, she sure should try.

And we don't know, 
I know that it shouldn't bother me, 
When I catch her fucking someone else's man

Get off the train and blow my mind again
she does it every time
straight off the rails into a masquerade 
she's cool, she's cool and why?

And we don't know
but I know that it doesn't bother me
when I catch her touched by someone else's hand
butterfingers in her mouth

By 17 she's been to everywhere
with every other man
A pound for every time was far too much
It cost her more than that

We don't know, I know that is shouldn't bother her
When she's lying spread in front of me at last
butterfingers in her mouth
