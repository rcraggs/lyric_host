Kick my sorry bones, out in to the road, I'm alone, I'm alone
Come to save the world, I just wanna be a girl, I'm alone, I'm alone
Tomorrow'll hurt, I just know

Crack my broken arms, against your broken heart, I just know that I'm alone
See, my angle wings, don't do a fucking thing, I am so. Let me go.

I fear for my life as everyone laughs at me
Silence would be nice, I am Jesus
I would like to save the earth but I'm scared of getting hurt
I would save you all again, but I'm scaled of all the pain. I am Jesus

I bless upon you life, but you never get it right. You are all so mortal
So choose to use your wings. It's easier than you think. Fly, fly

I fear for my sanity, everybody yells at me

I don't believe in my father any more
Yes, the princess was my fault, but I am not ashamed at all.
