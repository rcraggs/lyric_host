Poisoned apples make it OK to pretend that you're not young 
Poisoned apples make it EASIER TO LOVE SOMEONE

Poisoned Ivy makes it OK for me to love you ALL? at once. 
Just remember that it's not your choice and not my fault.

Just do whatever you want to and I promise you I shall never lose CONTROL.

Hang on 

Poisoned thoughts and wicked gestures couldn't make it any clearer 
and if you want to BE A CHILD THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE 
When it's over CASANOVA WILL JUST START IT ALL AGAIN 
and any LOVE you need WILL HAVE TO FEED YOUR SO-CALLED FRIEND 

Say what you do, I promise I won't lose control 
and I promise that I'll let you go home 

I think tonight, you've been let down real bad but it wasn't by me.

Poisoned apples make it ok but you wake up feeling grey
Poisoned ivy makes it easier to last the day
Maybe I'll see you someday and I really wish you luck
Cause I remember how a think [sic] think like this can fuck you up
