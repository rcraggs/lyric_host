See you're a lover and a cliche 
Townie with a 20 storey decay 
Ego's left flailing on a highway 
Sometimes we all wanna be real cool. 
But we'll never want to be like you.

'Cause you're always doing something but you're never doing something new

Cheap thrills but with nothing good to go on. 
Dumb crowd and all blending into noones
Sometimes I wonder if it's all worked out 
Or maybe it comes natural. 

Sometimes I wonder if there's somewherego where everyone else looks like me. 
And all the puff jackets in the high street 
Sit tight and wait til they look cool. 
But there's no such thing as cool.

We want to be somebody, but we all know there's no such thing as cool
We all feel quite pretty but we know


But we'll never want to be like you
Coz you're always doing something but you're never doing something new
