You dragged me up and leaved me low a-woah-a-hoaw 
as all the dust begins to glow a-woah-a-hoaw

and then you said the things that make me implode 
I love your charm offensive so a-woah-a-hoh.

Be paralyzed my dear, It'll only take a mo 
Be overwhelmed I'm here to leave you dear in spasms on the floor.
and then we dive for fear of flight

Be somewhere be somone in may way I'll show you how it goes
Be noone, be novasuper hear exploding out all over on the walls
we need to be here by tomorrow
