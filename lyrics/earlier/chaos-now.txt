Travesties of finite human nature
Silent sleep requires a settled mind
fidgeting and fretting stretches at a nervous gland
I sleep to dream to wake to think again

I lost my head inside let my mind reside
she wonders why I'm pleased with myself
I've learned to recognise the real thing, chaos now.

Ground control to everyone is falling
the age of aloneness passed away
The walls are coming in and I am laughing like an oaf

Ground control to earth to ground they're here

They're here x4

I took my mind aside and left the world behind
I wonder why she plays with herself
I've learned to understand solutions
redefine the problem wonder why we'll never get home
I've learned to recognise the real thing, chaos now
