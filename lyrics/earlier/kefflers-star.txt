Pull me in the other directions and haul me out of here
Wipe tears from my eyes and paint all my dark skys a bright and glowing blue

Hear my waining love song
Wipe my fading smile, collect all my hope
scattered and broken and sprinkle them with
stardust until they...

[Chorus]
Shine, like the lovers do, you...
Shine, shafts of moonlight in the morning
Sky keep my dreams alive

Wake me up and piece me together and
paint my closing eyes and polish my
skin all see-thru and thin
until you see me smile

Tear my chaging fears and
Love my craving doubts, look up at my stars
and see how the love you 
just call to them and then see how they...
