Fortune cookies on a spinning wheel it doesn't matter which you choose
It will also turn out black and blue
Fifteen fingers and an attitude all you ever need to know
Black is white and white apocryphal. 

The sun is out and the sky is beautiful 
Sorted seemingly meaningless seamless seamstress

Velvet knickers and some superglue, I don't (know?) what you're gonna do
Choose your weapon close your eyes and shoot
A two tonne smile that splits your face in two sending me
out of view chocolate buttons dance in solitude

The sky is white and the clouds are beautiful
Smiling, the art of being someone

What about today? I waiting but I'm grateful for you
What about tonight? Alone with you
What about today? I'm sorry but I'm aching for you
What about well, oh just whatever
The sky made it all blue

Flowers don't grow just anywhere but they grow real close to you
Make you damn hard to identify
Bye Bye child, hope you come back I'll finish what I want to do
just to give you a good seeing to.
