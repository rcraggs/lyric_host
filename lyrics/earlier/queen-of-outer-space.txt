Icon of my bidirectional hues
too much for a little boy to lose
So nearly the point in all point of views
so much for a little boy too

I want I need I'm sorry I didn't mean it
The world is just not good enough for you

Two drinks and I'm taking over the world
Tomorrow, not til I conquered the girl
Too easy this world's sown up, on a plate
All hail the queen of outta space

Have me 2 bottles sent to my room
Let me lie on the floor next to you
as you do what you do and you do

Have me 2 bullets sent to my room
let us fly through the night with these tunes
ring loud all around our face
Queen of outer space

To watch you, you'd think you were out of this world
Half-wit and half incredible girl
Tongue talking oh what a terrible waste
inhale the queen of outer space
