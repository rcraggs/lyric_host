Tracey loves Joey. They'll never be lonley As long as there's words left to say 

Ian loves Hazel, she doesn't understand, and he doesn't know how to say he loves her so. 

Cara loves nothing and that's the best way to be. I know coz she told me sweetly

Elaine still loves Stephen, I guess I still lovesher some, 
and maybe that's more than I'll ever lovesanyone.

Sarah disowned me, I think that she loves herself, and she has good reason coz so should everyone else.
