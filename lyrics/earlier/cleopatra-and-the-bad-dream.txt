After all I've been through I deserve to understand
It's all you can do to refuse to hold my hand
so as days turn to nightmares the good times begin
the light through your window won't penetrate my skin

I'm in too deep I just know it's gonna end in tears
Cleopatra and the bad dream

Is it everything you want it to be?
Mark Antony the drag queen
It's almost too easy but it helps you to see
that you're empty without me
paranoia as a killing machine
Cleopatra and the bad dream

Did the god I destroyed find a way to conceive?
Fighting fire with contempt and contempt with belief
and do I breath, it seems it should matter to me
