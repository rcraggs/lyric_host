I taught the world how to smile makes the morning less blue — ooh — ooh 

I'll hit on you if you do. 
Make nightmares come true.

I'll burn the world without fire, make your lows seem so true 
I'll fall for you if you do, be here when I need you

They said my ego'd dominate my flow. 
And it did you know
 
I the greater sex are easy, please make it easier for me. 
And if hope counts for something then I do want you, love. 

And if dreams and pain count for anything then you can have it all
And if love counts for nothing then I do want you,

You are so easy to choose. Look so fine dressed in flesh 
I'll want for you 'cause you're the best. 
Tonight and the rest of tonight.


I'll be destroyed if that's alright 
I'll fall apart if you like, 
I'll fall for you're here
and I'll fall again when you know
my mental state is not great and sometimes I overflow because 

the greater sex are easier but please make it easier for me
