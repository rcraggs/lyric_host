Love is a dirty word. Smiles are a form with the power of a thunderstorm
heads are an empty space bound by the sound of a frown on a lonely face

We are the world with a bottle and a 5p cigarette

Love is a phony laugh
I am a bum with a story and a photograph
The smile on my other face (shows that)
I am the one who put the bomb in the public place

Vice is a violence and a reasons and a benefit
My slide of life was the one with the lemon pip
I penned a pretendy sonnet on my jacket cuff
with a silly little line about love and some other stuff

De-rail-elled

Love is a voice in the night
I am a ghost with a smile and a fading light
The scars on my inner wrist
Show that I am a coward and a cheat and an anarchist

Jokes aren't funny but my laugh is an honest one
I clenched a fist to the boy with the loaded gun
and I sang an empty lament to a mourning bride
with stupid little lines about love and the afterlife
