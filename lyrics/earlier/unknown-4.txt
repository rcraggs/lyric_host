Looking back and feeling sickly
time has never passed so quickly
I'm all alone and felling all alone
The vagrant [sic probably flagrant] lack of conversation 
drive me into desperation
I lie here staring blankly at the phone
searching for an explanation

Breakdown in communication 
oh why don't you call?
Maybe we are both mistaken
and you sat there at home just waiting
or not alone at all

The world stops laughing at my reasons
as I slowly go to pieces 
This touch of love has got my fingers burnt
A lucky boy a granted wish
I feel so much depends on this
I've got so much to learn

It's not how it's supposed to happen I
just hope that you're still laughing
while I'm on my own
torment mind is do ridiculous
feels like children wait for Christmas
but the know that it will come
