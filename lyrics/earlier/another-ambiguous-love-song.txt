I can't remember you as a sunny day. hello hello 
so i think of you as I lie awake hello hello

Another ode to the obvious i like the way you couldn't say it, i don't really mind i don't really mind i don't really mind really doesn't matter to me, i don't think so

I don't really mind I don't really care 
I don't really know where to go from here 

When I came home and put the CD on and I just lay all night and listen to it.
