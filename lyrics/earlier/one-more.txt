One More rung for me to fall from
One more dream keeps me awake
One more light to blind me nightly 
Everything a boy could want

It's not shining but it's worth shouting
hoping someday you might hear me
It's not loud enough, everyone should know I love you

One more star to guide me through the 
nights we spend apart

She's the light that shines where we are (and it's)
One more reason to live
She's the sign to come alive
One more day in the sun x4

One less cloud for me to jump from
One more page in an empty book
One more thought to keep me thinking
