I know, it wasn't meant to feel this good, I know
but if I make it off and out of my mind
we'll feel better tomorrow

I know, I'll buy you with a smile and settle your soul
and if you make it off and into my life
I'll drown you with a passion every night (alright?)

I know, what ever feels right, 
Whatever hurts the most x4

Hello girl in the refectory, 
I think we could be pretty special if we work it out
I know you think I'm pretty strange or brave or both
But I don't know why or how you got me so wound up about a girl I don't know

I know I'm feeling pretty pretty and pretty low
