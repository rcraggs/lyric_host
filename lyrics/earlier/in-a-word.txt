I've got a problem for you, I've got a message from the gutter 
Looking down at all the dirt that's above me

I've got a craving for you I've got to listen to myself 
and running out of things to say

I can't make it to the end but I'll make it on my own 
when I'm suffering in silence, bleeding self control.

I've got it coming to me. I've got to tell you that all 
Thing that you wanted from me's everything that I can't do for you

[Chorus]

Here I am. There I was
In my world every little thing has gone
There you stand, here I crawl 
In a word, every little thing's gone wrong,


I've got a question for you I've got to find some answers 
a troubled mind in all deperate circumstances

I've got a really bad problem I'd like you to share
Everything that you want is everything I can't do for you

Wake, wide a wider, why, wida, a [sic]
