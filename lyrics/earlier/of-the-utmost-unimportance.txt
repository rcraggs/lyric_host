You watched me though different coloured eyes
All the way from my decay to ultimate demise 

I see things that are not (of?) your world
I cried so much I'm out of touch with why you need a girl

I want more than you could ever give
and you would flee if you could see the thoughts that lie within
Doubt and green and will to see more
I break so easily that I don't need to be no more

And maybe I'm not excellent at making you groan
And maybe I'm not brilliant at smiling alone
And maybe not proficient at breaking you heart
but I'm exceptional at falling apart

I doubt things that obviously are so
I look to far too things that are too much for me to know
You want me to follow you in tow [sic]
But I will sink beneath the things that keep (?) you tied so low

Taking you there, ??? that I care
tearing you apart

and if I can start to be a retard you'll love me with all of your heart.
