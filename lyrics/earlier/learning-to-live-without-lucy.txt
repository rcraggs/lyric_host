So, halfway there I'll start again, pick up the pieces, carry on alone 
Learning a whole new way of life, single and searching too hard If I'm honest.

Set it on fire, let it go, walk away.

[Sometimes that's not easy to do]

So after all is said and done, I got a ticket to War Ward One and Two, and Three 
I'm just a drain on everyone, it's better for all if I just leave right now. 
Don't let me go till I've said what I wanted to. d'oh I don't know

Now you have gone, I'll carry on, carry on
Somehow I after all we have done I'll carry on, carry on. somehow

The open air seems much less sweet. Learning to walk on my own feet is so hard 
They say that time heals but I'm not sure 
The cut you left looks awful deep from here 
and pages of my diary lie empty, the ink has long gone far too dry and the sun shines (x 4)


Set it on fire
