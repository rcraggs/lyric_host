Life seems so full of so many possibilities
I'd like to think that they're all open to me
I found you swimming in the deep end of my destiny
pulled me ashore with universal appeal

You took me to a purple beach with red and yellow sea
We stripped naked and just lay they a while
the sun when down about 23,07.
I must confess we didn't notice the time

Yeah-ee Yeah-ee Yeah-ee Yeah-ee
Yeah-ee Yeah-ee What a lovely
Day-ee Yeah-ee
Yeah-ee Yeah-ee Joy in surplus
what a perfect, such endeavors my best ever

I work next morning with a childish grin and kick-ass attitude
I'd like to think that it had nothing at all to do with you
a dream's a dream but when it's real it takes on new complications
I picked myself so hard my skin's turning blue
