Isn't it a lovely day for it. And isn't it a lovely time of the year. 
And isn't this a joke of a town to live 
And isn't that a depressing place to be. 
And isn't this a lovely day for it 
And isn't this a backward, boring haunt 
And isn't this a chronic way to waste your day

At our age we really should know better 
At our age 
And isn't it a perfect day to blow away this place 
And isn't it an open mind we share 
I think we should go further where everyone stares

And this place will never seem the same again 
But that's okay we really should go further 
at our age

But you're the coolest girl I ever met
You've even got pisces iscariot 
And isn't this the perfect way to show the rest 
that we're stars
while they're already dead
