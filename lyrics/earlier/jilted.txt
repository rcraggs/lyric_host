This one's out of my head, I'll try to carry on, with the knowledge that I'm all wrong

This one's over my head, I'm going to try to understand
That it isn't going to get better

Oh, any day now, any minute today, any lifetime maybe (not)

This boy's out of his depth, I'm going to try to stay afloat
with everything you gave me (air)

Now I'm out of my head, I'm going to write it all down
and send it to (you?) with a parcel bomb

It really isn't that simple
it really isn't' that simple
Save a thought for the jilted
It really isn't that simple

Now I'm out of my mind, I want to break the world's spine
with the hand that you bound together

Now I'm out on my own I'm going to pick the telephone
and ring you with a long song.
