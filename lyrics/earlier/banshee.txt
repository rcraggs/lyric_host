If I were an angel I'd write an epic love song called "The Angel and the Dead Boy in the Sky"

But if you were an angel the song would be an apology to make sure that I'd join you when I die

But And I'll let you down again I'll let you down again and

We're all waiting for the end When I'll let you again

If I were a banshee I'd whisper haunting nothings send you slowly crashing down towards your doom 
I wish you were an angel, 'cause it's a God's feeling generous I think I'm think I'm going to join you pretty soon.

I don't want to know, 'cause you don't have to know 
I don't like your clothes 'cause you don't like the cold.
I don't want to go, so, I'll see you tomorrow 
I've just heard the banshee's call
