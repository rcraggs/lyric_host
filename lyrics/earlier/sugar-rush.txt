I met a girl she had ribbons in her hair and dark brown diamonds in her eyes 
I made her smile with a wiggle and some freestyle living on the far side 

I met a girl she had 27 sisters her mother was just 24. 
Saffron smiles and a pocket full of time spend living on the far side

Days spent playing on the underground 
Gave us so much to lose.

I met a girl she had all of the right answers all of the questions started "why?" 
So much charm that I never came to harm while living on the far side 

So much time we're living so far underground 
Taught us so much that we didn't leave home 
So much time spent walking in straight line 
The lube's in the saddlebag

I pretend I never saw you
Ooh for a sugar rush
You pretend you just don't notice

Take on the world with a wink and a lip curl
Sad song #25
Super me sees a you in a pavement
leading to a far side
