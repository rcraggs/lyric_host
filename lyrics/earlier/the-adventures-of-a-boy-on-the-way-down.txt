On the way down I dashed my head against a tear shaped stone
sold my mind for a brand new soul
to start all over

One the way down
I cracked a mirror with a teenage stare
Cursed my looks for the next seven years
But now it's over

I find it hard to say "no"
and it's not as if the missive I wrote
event begin to explain why
our dreams remain unchanged

And I dance along the centre of the road
and I wave at all the angles as I go
Though our hopes are down by rain our dreams remain unchanged

It's a long way down
when your head is in the clouds and your wing [sic] doesn't work
15k miles from earth nothing to talk about

Don't look down
you might just see what you've always known
you're ugly sad and on your own
and no-one's going to help you
