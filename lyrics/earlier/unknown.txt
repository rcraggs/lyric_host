Oh what a good day what a cold, cold day for a morning Though I see your face in the sunshine It means the day is getting shorter.

Oh what a bad girl. I see you've broken all your promises. I left my heart in your ashtray. You left your clothes on my premises.

Oh what a bad dream I dreamt I dreamt about a good day. I saw my face in your tear drop. I taught myself how to rampage.

Oh what a good girl, I see you've tidied up your bedroom. I've seen you sleeping in your dad's car. I hope that there is lots of headroom.

Oh what a day, what a face, what a beautiful I'm meaning what I say (coz it's seminal). If it's a dream then it seems quite incredible.
