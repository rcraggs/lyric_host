Missing you like crazy, crazy though I am. 
I stumble through long dead days I'm owed 
Lets my mind betray me once so sleeps the days 
To mock the fool whose nights are spent alone

How proud am I, if only to know. 
Future days not spent alone 
And every time a something special, Let it be you

Slowly going crazy, crazy though it seems 
to wonder if your word's as good as mine 
Coming back, look out I will hide from you 
certain moments best left still to find.

This one's failure means so little. 
Come on girl, make it so much better. 
Someone should breath for you girl let it be me.
