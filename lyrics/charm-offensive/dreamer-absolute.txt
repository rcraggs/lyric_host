You feel only the sun (only the)
You hail only the won, only they who serve with nothing else to learn

You come only after him only after dark 
You sing only in key but never in the street where we all should be

Picking our teams, dreaming our dreaming of dreaming our dreams

You die but only at the end only after all is done
You never said goodbye never said anything never promised anything that you didn't mean never ever knew that we just died perchance to sleep perchance to dream our dreams just dreaming our dreaming our dreaming our dreams of living out our no-lives

Mmmmm? The summer's been good to me and I appreciate it
I feel like the warmth has done me good

The wood is yet to rot, my chair stands firm beneath me

You see only the good only the strong only the stable
You looking right past me (looking right through me) dreaming our dreaming our dreaming out
