I want to be anywhere other than here
you like it and all of my lovers don't mind
if I and all my words disappear
did I mention impending ascension?

I don't need this thing I feel for everyone
It doesn't take much not to cry right now

I grow wings whenever my town sucks me in
I notice that no-one is flying with me
