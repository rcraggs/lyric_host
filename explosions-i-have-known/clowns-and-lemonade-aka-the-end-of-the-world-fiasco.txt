I've got 10,000 reasons not the stay this time
Feels like we're bolted together and wrapped in twine. 
I don't want to keep in touch I just cannot take this much. 
You and I are strong enough.

Last week I wrote you a letter tryin-a let you go
But then our song started playing on the radio
I just couldn't lick that stamp, I just couldn't sign that note.
Guess that you will never know

Push and push and ....
Give it a rest I need a break. Bring on the clowns and lemonade.
As least I'm getting out and at least you're getting laid.
...

Sometimes, this kinda a weather, wanna go back home. 
Hear beats a 100 times a second can I last that long?
I don't wanna fall back down, after having climbed back up
You and I are strong enough.

Give it a rest I need a break. Bring on the clowns and lemonade.
As least I'm getting out and at least you're getting laid.
Give me a second to concentrate, bring on the clowns and lemonade 
As least I'm getting out and at least you're getting laid.
