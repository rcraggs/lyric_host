Burn it up, let's watch this city burn
Cleanse the streets of the tramps and the call-girls
If her eyes aren't weeping you couldn't get it up. Odd for a Saturday.
Your friends stop ringing. Your family will move away.

Burn it up, just a harmless city girl.
Learning chunks from the cracks in the pavement. 
When your friends stopped stealing, you couldn't give it up. To pay for your Saturdays.
Your heart stops beating every time he looks your away

Burn it all away x2

Burn it up, it's a hot and heavy world.
Feel the heat, as it boils in its own blood
When the rain starts drumming you've gotta get away. A break from monotony 
Your heart feels heavy and you haven't haven't slept for days
