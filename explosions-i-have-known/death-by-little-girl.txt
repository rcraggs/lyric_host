Did you know, there's a lot of stuff happening above
You can fool a lot of people a lot of the time, but you cannot fool the ones who're in love

Soon you'll know, a feeling unlike ever before. 
It'll make you feel inhuman it'll play with your mind
and scatter you all over the floor.

Do you know why? It's something called infatuation.
Sometimes it's fatal it's unkind.

Beautiful, you'll notice someone noone else does.
You can choose not to tell her but she'll always find out
You can always tell when someone's in love.

So out of her world, the end of a living boy
murderous curls. Death by little girl.
Harmless as she may look, she's a menace to society
of innocent nerds. Death by little girl.

In the park she prays on all the innocent fools
With her long and curly tresses and a criminal smile
The victims are the hot blooded few.

[Redacted final verse]
