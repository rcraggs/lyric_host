Be the sun, be the one with the stars in her eyes
Be the girl in the frame where they all know your name and a smile that can hypothesis
Be the flame in the ashes a kiss that grows stronger than hurricanes
Close your eyes, lay down for a while.

Take the leap, break the chains and let little girl free
Make it now make it June, but it's gotta come soon, 
'Cause we don't live forever dear. 
But your diary away I've got something to say that will change all eternity
Blow your mind and roll with the tide. Guess it's summer and sun again

And the bells are ringing out. This is the wonder, I warned you about. 
All the songs are sung about. Crystalline Ginger is stepping out. 

Touch the sky feel the rain hear the wind see the world
Be a doll be a star be a boy be a girl

Close your eyes lay down for a while
Guess it's dark, guess it's evening again.
