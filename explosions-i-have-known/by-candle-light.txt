There's a candle light on, and it's far away from me
Like a really distant love song that you heart can barely hear
It ticks and rhymes as a waste of time like the plans of mice and men
and I don't wanna lose you again

There's a candle light on, illuminating me 
with all the power of a glow worm, as it slowly falls asleep
The kids rush by to the visiting time 
of the sane but evil men
and I don't wanna lose you again x2

50 ways to a better health
50 ways to a greater wealth 
50 ways to kill yourself and I am still around

Oh

But the candle flickers on, 
It doesn't matter where your roots are, when they drop the atom bomb
It seems to wild that it makes me smile as I'm laying down my pen.
And I don't wanna lose you again.
