Wake up each morning, have 6 cups cups of coffee and fall back asleep on the floor, 
Rise in the evening regaining my feeling but don't want to think anymore

You're a bum and a loser the life that you choose will end it for you one day
But I'll do it my way

Turn on the TV watch shows about VD, hoping to see people die
Starting to shake I keep myself away just by poking myself in the eye
I have hope and ambition yet I sit here wishing for something that's clever to say
I'll do it my way

By nighttime I'm high and I'm feeling like dying, 
telling my friends that there's no point in trying
You cannot take anything with you, so you might as well lose it all now
I may not live life to the fullest, 
but at the rough end of the day

I'll do it my way
