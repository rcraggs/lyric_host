Monday morning comes around, shoving lazy weekends out the way
Postman wakes you up, delivering the debts you're yet to pay
Morning phones you now, in case there's something you've forgotten to say
Whiskey makes the hours more sane

Coffee, books and jays rolling into one big fuzzy haze
Friends have left for sun, guess that means there's no more sex today
Boring TV's on, in case there's programmes about life on the bay

Hey, you've got multiple changes to fail x2

Go, redecorate, pulling all the posters from the wall
Throw them in the street, residents protest at all the porn
Stumble back inside, you're the second most genuine fake

[The following lyrics were not on the recording of this song]

Stay inside, tensor choosy, chooses you to fight her wars
Count the cost, pick your battle to forget the ones you've lost
I'd rather die than face the world from/on this cross what I won
