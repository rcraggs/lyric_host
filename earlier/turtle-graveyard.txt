Hours away from anywhere, miles away from here
our daydreams are so vivid that we wake in tears
daydream girl in cotton how I love you so
I hope that you'll be waving me as I go
I smile at you as I'm sating into space while slowly gliding on to a better place
as the tears run down my face

We're always a start no matter how we shine.
