Living slow, dying bored, lying on the bar-room floor
isn't really what I had in mind
I block out the sunshine with my violent little finger
It doesn't really made now we're blind

We're all so low, that I cannot poke my eyes out
cause my hands are cold

Lying on the bedroom floor, we laugh about the 1st world word
taking all the fuck-ups in our stride
waltzing in and out of comas
hanging round like Casanovas
looking for a nice warm place to die

And I'm scaring all of the children with my WSOH
and it bothers me that on-one seems to care
Take me home how was I to know that no-one
loves you on your own

Everybody looks at me but that's ok cause I am scary
it's nice that people seem to care
Excuse me miss I've something I'd like to tell you
"I love you" I really do.
