If all of the boys in the world joined hands
we'd form a very pretty long line
and if all of the girls in the world joined in 
we would be the only ones to shine

But the world isn't mine but that's surely just a matter of time
You'll see me there and wonder if I cared. I did care.

If all of the stars in the sky fell to earth
there wouldn't be a reason for the night
and since all of the words I heave heard sound absurd
it takes much more to make things all seem right

And I'm counting the days, when the day comes I know I won't want to stay

I know that you don't want me to want too much
So I'll trade it all in for a new type of everything
I know that you don't want me to get too close
so I trade it all in for some type of everything

If all of the thoughts in my mind turned from time
and indignity to indifference and grace
And If wine turns my mind into jealousy and turpentine
the scars most deep will not be on my face
