I want you to. You wanted to. 
It's a wonder how we never do.

I followed you. You walked alone.
I wonder if you'll ever know

I wanted to, you wanted to
I want you to, I wanted to

Lost in heaven, lost together?
You get me high then eat me alive
So tip your hat, raise your class for the girl that wouldn't die
I want you to, you wanted to.

I lie alone, tired and cold
You're somewhere else, I hope alone
I dream a lot, you never to
I wonder if you want me to
