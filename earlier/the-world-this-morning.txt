I sent a letter of love
it told you to kill me tomorrow I know
but how is the world this morning?
how is the girl in the corner today?

I've got a song in my head 
permit me to sing it and I know
you'll love me as soon as you hear it
as soon as you love me I'll walk out of the door

I've got a pain in my head
I just hope that we're better off dead
how is the world mourning the reign of the morning today?

I've got a ticker-tape smile
don't worry too much if it looks like I'm crying
I'm laughing real hard inside here
at all of the life in my rear view mirror

I've got a pain in my chest
I only hope that it's cancerous

How is the world this morning?
How is the world this morning?
How is the world for the girl in the corner this morning today?
