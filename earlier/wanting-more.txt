Misery, is all that we are. 
Catastrophe, is all we ever wanted to be.

Blasphemy. I dreamt that I didn't rule the world. 
And woke up in a state of...

Apathy, why is nothing cool? 
Empathy drains my heart of every drop of 
Sympathy as if anyone cared about me 
at all. I woke up in the middle of a song 
You were singing along 


Leave me well alone. 
Leave me without direction or dignity.
Leave them all laughing. Leave in the aisles 
Leave them all lying on the floor... 
Leave them wanting more.
