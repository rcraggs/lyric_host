Oh is there a somewhere you can go on your own when you don't wanna stay home?

and your face is a mess and you cannot be bothered to make yourself beautiful?

Oh is there a someone who'll call you when you cry and she doesn't care that you can't talk 
she'll listen to silence and understand even if you don't

And all the angels want is a lullaby, but we can deal with it tomorrow

we'll live it and love and there always be something better around the corner 
and I think there's something special in the water

Is there a somewhere that the girl of your dreams will be there when you wake 
and she isn't destroyed by sunlight 
and the feelings you feel are somehow quite nice

Head and the air is clear and grass is sweet and worms
grow stronger from under your feet but there's something in my glass that shouldn't be here
