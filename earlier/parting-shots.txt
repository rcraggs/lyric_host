Turn on the radio, real slow time to learn a happy tune 
Pop babe, made up name, "real" fame think that I'm in love with you 

It's so hard to write pop records when you're sad 

Turn off the answer phone don't know why anybody's called today 

Try not to think about record man, what's he mean by "learn to play" 

I don't know who the A&R choose 
I'll sack my band and hire singers and dancers, they'll know what to do. 

Turn down the radio, I'm so tired of all those disco parties 
Bass lines, synthesized good times, it all sounds so 1990's 

I don't know if you feel it too, there comes a time 
to ask the singers and dancers, they'll know what to do.

Sometimes there comes a point in your life when you need something new. 
Sometimes I feel so unsung, may never write another tune. 
Smash my head against an empty bed for too 
Dream about all the singers and dancers, they'll know what to do.
