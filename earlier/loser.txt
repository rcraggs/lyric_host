There you are in your ballerina skirt and traffic cone
along. In the acrid state of mind you call your home.

And deep behind my amatory smile there hides a side of me that we don't really need

Loser, hater, lover

There you go with amiable distractions. 
I suppose you know its all a big joke.

Fucker, faker, hater
suffer, lover, apostate
oh you sad abhorrent loser

Anchorites have time always on their side
oh you altruistic (2 syllable word)
took you a while to find 
you're such a waste of time

loser hater, lover, faker, suffer
you meaningless abor, loser.
