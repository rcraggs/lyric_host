Falling child, landslide, come procure my delight
Oh what angels you are all of you
tonight we'll take the world

Star light landslide see the world through my eyes
Oh how brightly you shine, startle me

All animals taste the same
All animals love Elaine
and we'll dance to the sound of the rain

Bright side landslide, with both feet off the ground
oh how high we go together

Midnight landslide, fear the words in my smile
oh how clearly they shout out to you

And we dance in time with your words

All animals taste the same, all animals love Elaine
Your presence subsides the pain
when we go will I see you again?

Misguide landslide like the dead lead the live
How quickly they go, nowhere
??? hear the pain in my lies
??? how easily it comes out of me
