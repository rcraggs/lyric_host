Careful baby, watch your step, you're treading on your toes
Listen to the messages you sending out to everyone
and ooh, we don't look together now 

Traffic man, it's making jam of all my blood [written 'bulood']
stick my bones together with a slice of someone else's life

I know I don't look too good this morning, no
oh, it's only a game I know but the rules aren't the same
and the sunshine's hurting my eyes and the water's not what I wanted

and you soon find that is only and only.
