Cathy, Carina I can't believe I'm here 
Falling out of view of a fallchild

I get vertigo standing on the floor 
I don't want to listen to a sad song anymore

I cut myself on some chocolate 
I didn't know that, that could happen 
At least I know that nothing's wrong 

I walked myself to the altar 
The words, I know, they come, and go away

No wonder I lie here alone (langa bollar pa Bengt) 
No wonder I'm falling and we don't have to whisper

So slide away, let me fall 
'cause we'll never Fall together.
