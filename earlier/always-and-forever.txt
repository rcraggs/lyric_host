Kissing you lovers is only the start
always forever you'll sleep in my heart
what about all the stars that shine for you?
And what about all the nights you guide me through?

Isn't there somehow to make it more clear
I love you and that's all I want you to hear
and isn't everything I need to know
to love you through all the nights alone

The world seems alight with all that I see
The blue sky seems perfect just like my memories
and please never wonder if I still love you
Coz always and forever I do
