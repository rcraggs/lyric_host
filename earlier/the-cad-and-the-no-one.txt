She's on top o' the world, looking down
so she can't see me 'cause I'm above her in no 9 cloud
she can't see us for what we really are
a cad and a no-one a fool and a superstar

And this is my story and this is how it ends
I can't pretend I'm sorry I never promised anything

Dressing up as no-on, I guess that you didn't understand
what it takes to make it worthwhile, because I'm more than just a couple of hands
I admire your folly, it must have taken all your gall
but if you're not ultraspecial it was bound to be your downfall

Look at me!

But what is this all for, oh what a great surprise
here comes a girl with emotion in her eyes
what's it all about well here comes the sting
now I found a girl worth everything

"I did not love you"
