"But it's you Elaine" I know it's 60 days too late
but last night seemed the right time to explain
Do you feel that way? or were trying just to ease the pain
as long as you kiss me again then it's ok.

Do you remember all the things I said?
Even if you do you won't understand
It means so much to me it hurts my head
Is he thinking of you RIGHT NOW? thought not.

When I left you behind you know you wouldn't leave my mind
but the taste of you soon faded leaving bitter tastes of pain

And I'll see you soon but I don't know what I'm going to say
we could just go on like everything's ok

And how could I try to find out why even if I do I won't understand. 

The days will change and we will change some to
I'll hate the world but I'll still love you

Heaven sent you, what could I do?
Even when we part I'll love you
Heaven knew what she was doing
I'm sorry that I put you through it
even if you we die before we change
you're heaven sent Elaine

I wish you were here to prop me up and dry my tears
Lie awake and make my dreams more clear

And the boy you're with would give you all that I would give
which is everything I have while we both live.

And I'm insane about you Elaine
I promise you he doesn't love you nowhere near as much as I do

and I tried real hard to keep it in
but I'm crazy and you're a superstar
and heaven sent you
could I refuse?
Every time I wake I love you.

Heaven calls and all I see if all the world and you above it
Flapping wings of beauty and love
Making the world seem perfect
dropping by to paint my future [sic]
Sorry If I might confuse you
I shouldn't have said what I did that day
but you're heaven sent Elaine.
