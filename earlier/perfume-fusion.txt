On my may out of here going to learn how to fly
view the world from above with a glint in my eye
only you could stop me from being a fool for you

Going to sprout angel wings and then fly back to earth
watch you mourn the sad loss and then love you to death
only you could make suicide sound so cool

Shooting god in the fist with the gun in my hand
I smash the plate glass lies on which the world stands
only I will laugh on the morning I die

As the days turn to years and the years fade away
The moon turns the night to a faint epoxy grey
only you can look like a song penned in blue

I just don't want to see tomorrow, I'm just along for the ride
I drive through distraction like a soft perfume fusion
and a pink kangaroo
