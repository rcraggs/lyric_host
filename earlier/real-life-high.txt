Hey you wanna be beautiful I fully understand
take my hand you know where I began?

You don't wanna be a someone I once knew I know you can be someone else entirely
Roll out the pink ribbon sky

You are nothing but angel wanting to fly
don't hold back soar dear
hey you could be so beautiful you only need to smile
please let me make you smile. 

SHine now and give all the world what it wants
and then sit back and wait for it all

Let it feel let it go learn to be beautiful
Let's go, Let's go, make it all candy coat
Sun shine overload everyone want to ride
a real life high, why can't I?

Hey you standing at the bus stop the bus will never come
while you aren't shining
hey you don't you ever wonder if this day is the one?
