Oh, welcome to the other side
sit back and enjoy the ride
Hooray for mass suicide

I hope you're all safe inside
the bomb's going to drop tonight
Hooray for mass suicide

12-31-99
There won't be a better time to die
Hooray for mass suicide

Let's set our friends on fire
and we'll put the world to rights
Hooray for mass suicide
