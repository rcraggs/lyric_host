I poinsoned the apples in the orchard
and gave them to the babies for their breakfast

The mothers thanked me individually, that night 
Oh just what a wonderful waste of life 

I poisoned all the gasses in the open air
I scented all the flowers with my perfume. 

I captured such imaginations with my smile 
I made you forget about your problems for a while

The sense of direction is the first to go.
But what do I know? 

It's the type of thing that only ever happens in dreams 
I can't feel the comedown off the last great high. 

I suffered the indignity of childhood 
I shudder at the flowering of a million bloom 
I tried hard not to think of what was happening in their rooms

I clambered out of was [sic] deep isolation 
and since then my ascention has never stop [sic]
I guess I'll be the first to find out what is at the top

dejection

We don't x7 know
