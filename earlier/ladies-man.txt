Fortean TV's on
am I the only one to see it's lies?

I can't stay here too long (it's not too late)
I've heard to many sad songs
and I know their power
how to smile and reach out

Static eyes and greasy hair
only matters when you don't care
to those who won't stare
Everything that I have learned 
comes into fruition 
as fate falls over

Out of sight and my mind

I can still taste your tongue 
WElcome to my other world, where you comin' from?
I can still taste your tongue
