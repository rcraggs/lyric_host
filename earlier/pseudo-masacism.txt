In the corner darkness, eyes adjust
To see the dethrowned prince

Shuffling through the first looking for
cotton wool and other things he can
hide inside his pocket because he knowns
that you'll never look in his pockets
cough up blood and sail on it
to whever you want to go

(in my head)
She likes suffregettes and living
I like santa claus and accidents
and I can't just go on breathing (without breeding)

Calling occupants of planet down
do you want some air or something?
I'm sorry to hear about your Major Tom
I dreampt that I was dreaming
and woke to find myself wide awake again

In my head, she likes acrobats and women
I like carnivals and afterthoughts
I can't just go on living without breathing
