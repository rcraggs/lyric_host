Coded messages from Lovers makes you want sleep a little longer tonight
Antics underneath your covers. makes you wish that there was someone sharing with you

Tonight we'll dream a dream free from feeling suicide (I hope that God won't mind) 
Tonight we'll lie awake and try to fake it

Tonight I feel we'll get it right
Places of self-mutiliation so cliche but it's something to show your friends
I prescribe intoxication so you'll forget and have to do it again 

Today let's make the same mistake as we did yesterday 
We fall asleep and wake on up again 
Today we'll wish the stars were there so we could wish lives away

It's a sign of the times that we really don't mind that we're gonna grow up to be old
It's a sign of the times that we're all afraid of suicide
Long, live the death of rock and roll
