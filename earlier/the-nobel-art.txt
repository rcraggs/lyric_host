I guess I'll never know, what makes me so fucking ultraspecial
what makes us the cliche indy couple
Stroll on, til it looks like something's going on 

I guess I'll never learn, what starts the fire that starts to make desire burn
Why your lovelife was ever any of my concern
Cause it feels like there is something going on
and it tastes just like I'm not the only one

So it's time to do the sad song

Though I sometimes feel like letting go
I kept on holding on and waiting to shine through
THough I often feel like staying home
You never know when I'm [sic] meeting somebody like you 
I never thought that it would ever come this true
and now it's time do to the overture

I guess you wonder why, such a dodgy hairdo is such a flimsy alibi
Acting so pathetic is enough to make just anybody cry
but it seems to have worked tonight
I guess I want to find not satisfaction but a little piece of mind
such a late starter that I'm taking you all from behind
