Let it go. It wasn't meant to be a love song
sucking on a hemp-shaped smile
tastes of a dream called suicide
please world, just let it go

Let it go. Try hard to stay together
I know, it's much easier to fall apart
just please let it go.

I don't know, what we should do, where we should go
I know we should never never ever ever
count ourselves lucky to be alive

[Chorus]
Cut my heart and suck the blood
loose yourself and search for love
when we die we'll fly to Mars
I read it in the superstars
I can feel it in your heart

Let it go. I never tried to write a sad song
it's just the way it all turns out
it say's a lot about mind [sic] so please just let it go

Let it go, it soon just falls to pieces, 
I know but that's just the way it has to be
Please just let it go
