Largo Captitivio sees faces in the lino
Largo Captitivio runs naked through asylums
Largo Largo

Largo Captitivio he'll be the one to cast the first stone
Largo Captitivio he hears voices in the telephone
Largo Captitivio he's taking on the world solo
Largo

Largo Captitivio fashion victim in his own way
Largo Captitivio he wears whatever he wore yesterday
Largo Largo

Largo Captitivio daily dose of anticeptic
Largo Captitivio makes the world seem less pathetic
Largo Captitivio although he says he'll never forget his first love
Largo Largo

he never settled for just Ok
he learned to love while on a motorway
he just kept yelling out faster faster Largo Largo

Don't ever let him ask you why it never seems so sunny inside
'Cause he'll expect to take you home

Largo
Rocket man without a space suit he says he doesn't need it
that's why he's never coming home
